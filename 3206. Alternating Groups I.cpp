/*
There is a circle of red and blue tiles. You are given an array of integers colors. The color of tile i is represented by colors[i]:

    colors[i] == 0 means that tile i is red.
    colors[i] == 1 means that tile i is blue.

Every 3 contiguous tiles in the circle with alternating colors (the middle tile has a different color from its left and right tiles) is called an alternating group.

Return the number of alternating groups.

Note that since colors represents a circle, the first and the last tiles are considered to be next to each other.

Example 1:
Input: colors = [1,1,1]
Output: 0
Explanation:

Example 2:
Input: colors = [0,1,0,0,1]

Output: 3
Explanation:
Alternating groups:

Constraints:
    3 <= colors.length <= 100
    0 <= colors[i] <= 1
